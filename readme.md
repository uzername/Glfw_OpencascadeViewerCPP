GLFW: 3D Viewer (C++|GLFW) {#occt_samples_glfw}
==================

A sample demonstrating usage of OCCT 3D Viewer within a window created using GLFW.

Use CMake to build the sample.

Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux

Required: glfw

Here comes my notes
==================
This sample was ripped off the OpenCascade package. You know, building that from scratch is no good, ancient CMAKE writings are challenging. 

I go simple way, and make C++ project myself
